        <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools.<br>
            Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.<br>
            According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:</p>

        <p class="align-content-center">"A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. <br>
                                        Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, <br>
                                         we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company."[3]</p>
        <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. <br>
            It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.[4] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton,<br>
            and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.[5]</p>
